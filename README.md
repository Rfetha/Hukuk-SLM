## Weights

> **Note (2026-09-09):** the weights repository is temporarily **private** while open defects are being resolved. The link below will 404 until it is made public again.

Published 2026-09-09: [`Rfetha/HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M`](https://huggingface.co/Rfetha/HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M) — a single GGUF,
`HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M.gguf`, 2.783.446.720 bytes (2,592 GiB),
`sha256 755e15e92e9f7021934f2d5eada6c1f02fcc92be23f0536b0c2a0a9586e7bffc`.

```

Read the model card there before use. Two constraints are stated on its first screen: the
model cannot reproduce the published figure on its own (the retrieval index is not yet
distributed), and the product path used to return an empty answer on **4 of 80** questions —
a non-termination defect that was recorded, not hidden. It was **fixed on 2026-09-11**
([ADR-0080](docs/adr/0080-urun-yolu-zorunlu-dusunce-kapatmasi.md)): the product path now forces
the thinking channel closed in a second pass, and blank answers went **4/80 → 0/80** while
truncation fell from 8.75% to 3.75%. ⚠️ The fix lives in `hakhukuk/servis.py` — a caller who
drives `llama-server` directly, without this package, still hits the original defect.

Most of the work in a legal assistant is not answering. It is **refusing to answer when the
sources do not support one.** A confident, wrong article number is worse than silence — it is
the failure mode that makes a legal tool dangerous. `HakHukuk-4B-v0.1` (internal id `tgta_v1`)
is trained for both halves of that job: **ground** the answer in the supplied statute, and
**abstain** when the statute does not cover the question.

**Who it is for:** a Turkish citizen who is not a lawyer (the product goal) · a researcher
working on Turkish legal NLP (the record goal).

---

## Can I install and run it today? — **PARTLY**

That is the honest answer to the first question, and it changed on 2026-09-11: **the product
exists as running code.** What is still missing is **distribution** — two of the four pieces
below cannot yet be handed to a stranger.

| piece | status | evidence (measured, 2026-09-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Model weights (Q4_K_M GGUF, **2.59 GiB**) | **published** 2026-09-09 — but the repository is **private today**, so an `HF_TOKEN` with access to it is required | `Rfetha/HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M`, a single file, **2,783,446,720 bytes**, `sha256 755e15e9…86e7bffc`. The identity gate is [`hakhukuk/indir.py`](hakhukuk/indir.py) (`GGUF_SHA256` · `GGUF_BAYT`); it **fired and held** on the container run · [ADR-0071](docs/adr/0071-v1-release-artefakti-tek-gguf.md) |
| Retrieval index (**40,496** articles) | **the one blocker.** Exists locally, is **not in git**, and is **published nowhere**: the distribution decision was taken (an HF dataset) and then **not executed**, because the corpus is about to grow 8.4× | `git ls-files data/index` → **2 `KUNYE.json` files and nothing else**; `du -sh data/index/mevzuat_bge_m3_s2` → **80 MB**. The two-way index path (volume first, HF second) is [ADR-0078, clause 4](docs/adr/0078-konteyner-dagitimi-rejim-kilidi.md); with neither present, `indir` **deliberately** exits non-zero and prints the exact path |
| Serving layer (API / CLI / TUI) | **exists as code and runs.** `pip install -e .` produces three commands; the container path answered real questions end to end | `git ls-files hakhukuk/` → **11 files** (`cli.py` · `tui.py` · `api.py` · `servis.py` · `araclar.py` · `terazi.py` · `istem.py` · `tipler.py` · `indir.py`) · [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) `[project.scripts]` → `hakhukuk` · `hakhukuk-tui` · `hakhukuk-api` · `pytest tests/` → **281 passed, 2 xfailed** |
| Prompt | **a shippable artifact**, no longer a copy inside the measurement scripts: [`hakhukuk/istem.py`](hakhukuk/istem.py) is the single source | the measurement pipeline imports it too (`scripts/olcum_uretim/gen_eval_grounded.py:55` → `from hakhukuk.istem import …`); [`tests/test_istem.py`](tests/test_istem.py) is a gate — change the text without raising `ISTEM_SURUMU` / `DAMGA_v1` and it fails |

**So a `git clone` on its own does not get you a working product.** The index is not in it, and
in that case `indir` fails **on purpose** rather than serving a citizen a half-built retriever.
With an `HF_TOKEN` and an index directory of your own, the container path below runs.

**And it does not reproduce `0.8011`.** That figure belongs to the **measurement pipeline**; the
container carries the **product path** (see below). Packaging itself is done: the **product
version is `v0.3`** (tagged 2026-09-09, [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)) while the model
artifact is still `HakHukuk-4B-v0.1` — versioning is deliberately split
([ADR-0065](docs/adr/0065-bolunmus-surumleme.md)). `v1.0` was **not** granted, and the blocker is
the measuring instrument, not the model ([ADR-0077](docs/adr/0077-v1-0-verilmedi-v0-3.md)).

→ **The container path:** [`docker compose up`](#running-it-with-docker-compose--the-container-path).
**Verified end to end on 2026-09-11:** `indir` exited **0**, `llama` went **healthy**, `app` came
up, the API answered **two different questions** with HTTP **200** and an empty query returned
**422** ([record #67](docs/record/research_log/2026-09-12-konteyner-ve-alet-onarimlari.md)).

---

## Running it with Docker Compose — the container path

> ✅ **VERIFIED END TO END — 2026-09-11.** `docker compose up` **ran**: the `indir` box exited
> **0** (the `sha256` + byte-count gate **fired and held**), `llama` went **healthy**, `app` came
> up, and the API answered **two different questions** with HTTP **200**; an empty query returned
> **422**. Image sizes were **measured**, not estimated: `hakhukuk:0.3.0` **2.13 GB** ·
> `llama.cpp:server-cuda-b10902` **6.99 GB** · `torch` inside the image is **`2.14.0+cpu`**
> (no CUDA wheel was pulled). Weights and index are **not baked into the image**.
> Measurement: [`g20-imaj-olcumu/BULGU.md`](outputs/eval/g20-imaj-olcumu/BULGU.md).
>
> ⚠️ **Three caveats, none of them fixed.** (1) After a `git clone` **a human must populate the
> index directory** — `G8` is on hold, so the index is neither on HF nor in the image; `indir`
> **deliberately fails** in that case and prints the exact path **and** the depth requirement.
> (2) The corpus now lives in **three places** (repo · image · volume); `indir` checks the
> image↔volume `sha256` equality **on every run**, but a repo↔image divergence is **not**
> checked. (3) End-to-end verification used **two questions**; the product path's known
> **blank-answer** defect (§7.9) was **not** measured by this run.

Three boxes, two daemons, two images
([ADR-0078](docs/adr/0078-konteyner-dagitimi-rejim-kilidi.md) ·
[ADR-0082](docs/adr/0082-app-kutusu-host-sapmasi.md)): a one-shot `indir` box that pulls the
GGUF at a **pinned revision** behind a `sha256` + byte-count gate, a GPU `llama` daemon, and a
CPU `app` daemon. If the gate does not hold, `indir` exits non-zero and **neither daemon ever
starts**.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=...                # the weights repo is PRIVATE — without a token: 401
export HAKHUKUK_INDEKS_DEPO=...    # see below — deliberately EMPTY by default
docker compose up
```

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| API | `127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `llama-server` | `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `HF_TOKEN` | **required.** [`Rfetha/HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M`](https://huggingface.co/Rfetha/HakHukuk-4B-v0.3-Q4_K_M) is **private** today; if it is undefined, compose fails **before** starting anything |
| `HAKHUKUK_INDEKS_DEPO` | **deliberately empty.** `G8` (index distribution) is on hold, so **no published index repository exists**. Either place the index in the volume by hand or name a repository — otherwise the `indir` box fails **on purpose** |
| requirements | an NVIDIA GPU + Docker. Measured environment: Docker **28.4.0** · compose **v2.39.4-desktop.1** · RTX 5070 Ti Laptop **12227 MiB** · driver **591.97**. The `gpus: all` key needs compose **v2.30+** |
| image tag | `hakhukuk:0.3.0` — the **product** version ([`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)). The model artifact is still `HakHukuk-4B-v0.1`: versioning is split ([ADR-0065](docs/adr/0065-bolunmus-surumleme.md)) |

**Both daemons publish to the host's `127.0.0.1` only.** There is no authentication and no rate
limit: this is a local, single-user deployment, and hosting remains open decision `S9`.

### The container does **not** produce the published `0.8011`

`0.8011` is the **measurement pipeline's** number: harness ON, `k=10`, no sufficiency preamble,
two-pass forced thinking closure, `q8_0` KV cache. The container carries the **product path**.
On 2026-09-11 the product path was brought into the measurement pipeline's regime
([ADR-0080](docs/adr/0080-urun-yolu-zorunlu-dusunce-kapatmasi.md)) and empty answers went
**4/80 → 0/80** — but **its mass was never measured**, and `0.8011` **is not the product path's
number** ([comparison](outputs/eval/g22-rejim/KARSILASTIRMA.md)).

### The flags are a **decision**, not a preference

The KV cache quantization `q8_0` is a human decision (2026-09-11): with fp16 KV,
`wrong_ref_rate` degrades **0.0769 → 0.1553 (2.0×)**
([measurement](outputs/eval/g22-kv-fp16/KUTLE.md)). [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) **forces**
these flags; whoever starts `llama-server` by hand has to write them **themselves**
([MODEL_CARD §7.10](MODEL_CARD.md)).

## Headline numbers

**Regime:** DEV split, `n=80` · harness **ON** (hybrid BM25 + `bge-m3`, `k=10`, `RRF_K=10`,
CPU-only) · **no sufficiency preamble** · seed 3407 · 900-char chunk clip · generation
budget **1536** · judge `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.

| `coverage` | 0.9375 | same manifest |

**The harness-OFF ("ceiling") regime was NOT re-measured in this unit.** The old `v1`-unit
ceiling figure is not comparable to today's numbers and is not repeated in this document.

## Competitor comparison — an **equal exam**, three readings

Same 80 questions, same context, same budget, same judge. **Equality was not assumed, it was
measured:** `recall@10` = **0.9500** for all four subjects and `context_shown` is
**byte-identical in 80/80**
([`f04-rakip-onsozsuz/KALIBRASYON_ve_OZET.md`](outputs/eval/f04-rakip-onsozsuz/KALIBRASYON_ve_OZET.md)).

The mandatory calibration step (28 competitor abstention items read by eye) found that the
abstention detector **over-counts refusals on the Gemini template** — meaning part of our lead
was an artifact of the instrument. The three readings below correct for that; **the binding one
is the most conservative: GÖZ-katı (strict-by-eye)**
([ADR-0064](docs/adr/0064-v1-kapisi-uc-maddeli-on-kayit.md)).

| faithful-answer mass | tool (raw) | by-eye, medium | **by-eye, strict (binding)** |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **HakHukuk-4B-v0.1** | **0.8011** | **0.8011** | **0.8011** |
| Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite | 0.6746 | 0.7058 | 0.7058 |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite | 0.7174 | 0.7403 | 0.7622 |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash | 0.6925 | 0.7050 | 0.7425 |

*(Our arm is identical across all three readings: all 80 items were read by eye and the
**tool ↔ eye difference is zero**.)*

Other axes (raw tool numbers, same file):

| axis | ours | 3.1 FL | 3.5 FL | 3.5 Flash |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| A1 · gold-retrieved | **0.8902** | 0.7900 | 0.8449 | 0.8523 |
| **fabricated articles** | **0** | 1 | 4 | 4 |
| truncated items | 4 (5.0%) | 5 (6.2%) | 0 | 4 (5.0%) |
| mean completion tokens | 782.5 | 861.5 | **171.1** | 699.4 |

### Sentences this table does **not** support

1. **"We would pass on TEST too."** The measurement is on **DEV**. The frozen TEST set's
   retrieval ceiling is ≈75%
   ([ADR-0069](docs/adr/0069-kabul-testi-tavan-kullanimi-raporlamasi.md)) and the acceptance
   test **has not been run**.
2. **"A verdict that survived a judge panel."** It is still a **single judge family**
   (`gpt-4o-mini`), there is **no** κ, and self-preference was **not measured**. This is an open
   debt — the plan's **`HP`** phase closes it.
3. **"The model got this much better."** Most of the gain came not from training but from
   **measurement** (see below).

---

## Where the gain came from: **the weights never changed**

Phase 0 ran **zero training runs** and the number moved from 68.4% to **80.1%**. What was found
was not a better model but **defects in the measuring instrument** — five of them, every one in
the *"produces a wrong number without erroring"* class, every one of which **passed the numeric
gate**, and every one caught only by **reading by eye** or by opening and reading the run manifest.

| # | defect | effect | source |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The questions had been **stripped of their context** — 5/10 retrieval misses were really "a lawyer reading this question alone cannot name the gold article" | `recall@10` 0.8750 → **0.9375** | [ADR-0067](docs/adr/0067-soru-onarimi-dev-test-v2.md) |
| 2 | The defect was not in BM25 but in **fusion**: at `RRF_K=60`, "mediocre in both arms" beat "perfect in one arm" | `RRF_K` 60 → 10; `recall@10` 0.9375 → **0.9500** | [ADR-0068](docs/adr/0068-rrf-k-60-to-10.md) |
| 3 | **81% of the DEV ↔ TEST gap came from set composition** (not stratified by article length) | the acceptance test's ceiling was pre-registered at ≈**75%** | [ADR-0069](docs/adr/0069-kabul-testi-tavan-kullanimi-raporlamasi.md) |
| 4 | **The generation budget was not equal to the competitor's, and it was against us** — ours 1024, theirs effectively 1532 | one formula for everyone: budget **1536**, identical across all four subjects | [ADR-0070](docs/adr/0070-uretim-butcesi-esitlendi.md) |
| 5 | **The gate clause had NO ANCHOR** — `v1.0` clause (3) said *"M5 must not rise above today's"*, but `tgta_v1`'s M5 had **never been measured in any unit**; the clause referred to itself | anchor read from ADR-0039 (**base**, not the competitor); M5 re-run on both arms | [ADR-0073](docs/adr/0073-m5-rejimine-dry-eklendi.md) · trap **2.17** |

*(These five are **Faz 0's** findings. A sixth instrument defect was found **the day
before**, in the B10 round: the abstention detector turned out to be prompt-regime dependent
([ADR-0061](docs/adr/0061-cekinme-dedektoru-istem-rejimi-bagimliligi.md),
[#61](docs/record/research_log/2026-09-06-dedektor-onarimi-b10-yeniden.md)). Its **competitor-side**
manifestation was measured inside Faz 0 — the F0.4 calibration found **6 clear false positives**
on competitor arms and **0** on ours, which is why the binding reading is the **most conservative**
one ([`f04 calibration`](outputs/eval/f04-rakip-onsozsuz/KALIBRASYON_ve_OZET.md)). The same
detector was wrong a **third** time on 2026-09-07, in blind mode: **6 of 6** flags were false
positives.)*

---

## The `v1.0` gate — three clauses, pre-registered formula

The formula was written **before any competitor number was seen**; the numbers were then derived
mechanically ([ADR-0064](docs/adr/0064-v1-kapisi-uc-maddeli-on-kayit.md)).

| clause | verdict | number | source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(1)** mass ≥ 3.5 Flash − 2.0 points | **PASSED** | strict-by-eye: **0.8011 ↔ threshold 0.7225** → **+5.86 p** | [`f04 summary`](outputs/eval/f04-rakip-onsozsuz/KALIBRASYON_ve_OZET.md) |
| **(2)** misattribution does not regress | (true by definition today) | anchor re-pinned at **8/80** in the new unit; it binds at the **next training round** | [`GOZLE_OKUMA_80.md`](outputs/eval/f02-biz-onsozsuz/GOZLE_OKUMA_80.md) |
| **(3)** M5 (blind/parametric) does **not** rise — anti-target | **PASSED** | memorized mass **0.3899 ↔ base 0.4697** (tool) · **0.4057 ↔ 0.4739** (by eye) | [`outputs/eval/f07-m5-anti-hedef/KUNYE.json`](outputs/eval/f07-m5-anti-hedef/KUNYE.json) · [`GOZLE_OKUMA_CEKINME.md`](outputs/eval/f07-m5-anti-hedef/GOZLE_OKUMA_CEKINME.md) |

**The version is still `v0.1`, on purpose.** Versioning was deliberately split
([ADR-0065](docs/adr/0065-bolunmus-surumleme.md)): the **product version** (`v0.2 → v1.0`) passes
through the product's own gate, while the **claim version** stays tied to the mid-gate that
**failed** on 2026-08-06
([ADR-0045](docs/adr/0045-ara-kapi-merge-onarim-kontrolu.md)). A failed gate stays failed —
it was neither loosened nor redefined.

---

## What it does **not** promise

- **It is not legal advice.** It is not a lawyer and its output does not substitute for legal
  advice. Verify every article number against [mevzuat.gov.tr](https://www.mevzuat.gov.tr).
- **It is not 100% accurate.** On the 80-question DEV set, **8 misattributions** and
  **4 over-refusals** were measured (tables above). The measurement is the verdict of a
  **single judge family**.
- **Currency lives in the library, not in the weights.** Legislation changes; weights do not.
  Keeping statutes current is the retrieval layer's job. This is a design decision, not a gap.
- **Scope: current Republic-of-Türkiye legislation only.** Ottoman-era material, case-law
  interpretation and foreign law are out of scope.
- **No parity claim.** The comparison above is on **DEV**, with a single judge family, and
  cost is not normalized.

---

## How it was built

```
raw base ──┬── LoRA SFT   (grounding)   → τ_g
           └── LoRA ORPO  (abstention)  → τ_a
                                          │
              simultaneous 2-way raw TIES ┘  → HakHukuk-4B-v0.1 (tgta_v1)
```

Two skills that **actively fight each other**: training for grounding collapses abstention, and
training for abstention collapses grounding. **Neither branch is usable alone**; the merge
restores both. Every branch is trained **independently from the raw base** — the task-vector
definition (`τ = θ_ft − θ_base`) requires it.

The ratios behind this section were measured in the **old (`v1`) unit** and are not comparable
to the headline numbers above; per-branch figures and manifests live in
[`docs/record/kollar.md`](docs/record/kollar.md).

## Roadmap

The order was **binding** (human decision, 2026-09-07). That round closed at **115/115** on
2026-09-12 and its plan was deleted; the defect register and the handover live in
[ADR-0083](docs/adr/0083-kusur-sicili-adrye-tasindi.md), and what comes next is in the
[work order](docs/superpowers/00-IS-SIRASI.md):

| phase | what | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`HP`** — judge panel | a second and third judge family, κ, self-preference measurement | no number stays the verdict of one family |
| **Hat A** — packaging (runs parallel to `HP`) | the `hakhukuk/` package: prompt artifact · types · service · CLI · TUI · index distribution | **an installable product** |
| **Phase C** — documentation layer | [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) · [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) · [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) · [`docs/MIMARI.md`](docs/MIMARI.md) — written 2026-09-07 | **`v0.2` RELEASE** |
| **Hat B** — model | B1 (misattribution) · `τ_a` amplitude · gate run + frozen-TEST acceptance test | **the `v1.0` gate** |

`v2` = the application/API layer on top of this same model. arxiv is a **by-product**, not the goal.

## The research record is itself the asset

In this repository **negative results are first-class**, and the places where our own published
claims were refuted are **stamped** in the record: runs invalidated by their own pre-registered
gates · a normalization decision **reversed** because measurement contradicted it
([ADR-0052](docs/adr/0052-merge-norm-dengeleme-hukmu-tersine.md)) · a mid-gate that **failed**
([ADR-0045](docs/adr/0045-ara-kapi-merge-onarim-kontrolu.md)) · and the admission that *"the gain
came from measurement, not training"*
([#62](docs/record/research_log/2026-09-06-faz0-olcum-zinciri.md)).

Numbers are **sourced, not remembered**: every result's metric, `n`, judge, seed and output file
are pinned in the run manifest (`KUNYE.json`).
